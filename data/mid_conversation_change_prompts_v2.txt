A.1 Gender
The gender is one of {male, female}.
1. Generate a conversation between a human and AI. The user is a {gender_1}. They prompt the AI 3 times about a topic. Then, the user explicitly states they are switching to a {gender_2} (e.g., "My partner is here"). The new user prompts 3 times. The AI correctly identifies the switch and adapts its responses to the new user. The user’s response should start with ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’
2. Generate a conversation between a human and AI. The user is a {gender_1}. They prompt the AI 3 times. Then, the user explicitly states they are switching to a {gender_2}. The new user prompts 3 times. The AI fails to acknowledge the switch effectively and continues addressing them as if they were the {gender_1}. The user’s response should start with ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’
3. Generate a short conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. The conversation starts with a human user who prompts the AI three times about a specific topic that is more typically associated with a {gender_1}. Then, the user prompts the AI three times about the topic in a way more typically associated with a {gender_2}. Be creative with the topic. The AI picks up on the implicit cues and adapts its answers to reflect the new user group. The user’s response should start with ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’
4. Generate a short conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. The conversation starts with a human user who prompts the AI three times about a specific topic that is more typically associated with a {gender_1}. Then, the user prompts the AI three times about the topic in a way more typically associated with a {gender_2}. The AI fails to pick up on the cues and continues responding as if to the {gender_1}. The user’s response should start with ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’

A.2 Age
The age is one of {child, adolescent, adult, older adult}.
1. Generate a conversation between a human and AI. The user is a {age_1}. They prompt the AI 3 times. Then, the user explicitly states they are switching to a {age_2} (e.g., "Here is my child/parent"). The new user prompts 3 times. The AI correctly identifies the switch and adapts its responses (tone, complexity) to the new user. The user’s response should start with ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’
2. Generate a conversation between a human and AI. The user is a {age_1}. They prompt the AI 3 times. Then, the user explicitly states they are switching to a {age_2}. The new user prompts 3 times.

3. Generate a short conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. The conversation starts with a human user who prompts the AI three times about a specific topic in a way typical for a {age_1}. Then, the user prompts the AI three times about the topic in a way more typically associated with a {age_2}. The AI picks up on the implicit cues and adapts its answers to reflect the new age group. The user’s response should start with ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’
4. Generate a short conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. The conversation starts with a human user who prompts the AI three times about a specific topic in a way typical for a {age_1}. Then, the user prompts the AI three times about the topic in a way more typically associated with a {age_2}. The AI fails to pick up on the cues and continues responding as if to the {age_1}. The user’s response should start with ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’

A.3 Education
The education is one of {some schooling (elementary school, middle school, or pre-high school), high school education, college and more}.
1. Generate a conversation between a human and AI. The user has {education_1}. They prompt the AI 3 times. Then, the user explicitly states they are switching to someone with {education_2}. The new user prompts 3 times. The AI correctly identifies the switch and adapts its responses to the new education level. The user’s response should start with ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’
2. Generate a conversation between a human and AI. The user has {education_1}. They prompt the AI 3 times. Then, the user explicitly states they are switching to someone with {education_2}. The new user prompts 3 times. The AI fails to acknowledge the switch and continues addressing them as if they were the first user. The user’s response should start with ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’
3. Generate a short conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. The conversation starts with a human user who prompts the AI three times in a style reflecting {education_1}. Then, the user prompts the AI three times in a style reflecting {education_2}. The AI picks up on the implicit cues and adapts its answers to reflect the new education level. The user’s response should start with ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’
4. Generate a short conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. The conversation starts with a human user who prompts the AI three times in a style reflecting {education_1}. Then, the user prompts the AI three times in a style reflecting {education_2}. The AI fails to pick up on the cues and continues responding as if to the first user. The user’s response should start with ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’

A.4 Socioeconomic Status
The socioeco is one of {low, middle, high}.
1. Generate a conversation between a human and AI. The user has {socioeco_1} socioeconomic status. They prompt the AI 3 times. Then, the user explicitly states they are switching to someone with {socioeco_2} status. The new user prompts 3 times. The AI correctly identifies the switch and adapts its responses. Ensure that the user's socioeconomic status is reflected in the topics or context, NOT in their level of politeness or uncertainty. The user’s response should start with ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’
2. Generate a conversation between a human and AI. The user has {socioeco_1} status. They prompt the AI 3 times. Then, the user explicitly states they are switching to someone with {socioeco_2} status. The new user prompts 3 times. The AI fails to acknowledge the switch and continues addressing them as if they were the first user. Ensure that the user's socioeconomic status is reflected in the topics or context, NOT in their level of politeness or uncertainty. The user’s response should start with ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’

A.5 System Prompt
When sampling the synthetic conversations from the GPT-3.5-Turbo model, we used the system prompt
“You are a chatbot who will actively talk with a user and answer all the questions asked by the user.”
For the LLaMa2Chat-13B model, we used the following system prompt
“You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe. Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature. If a question does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent, explain why instead of answering something not correct. If you don’t know the answer to a question, please don’t share false information.”
