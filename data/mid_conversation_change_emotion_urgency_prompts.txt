2. Generate a conversation between a human and AI. The user is feeling {emotion_1}. They prompt the AI 3 times. Be creative with the topics.

A.3 System Prompt
When sampling the synthetic conversations from the GPT-3.5-Turbo model, we used the system prompt
“You are a chatbot who will actively talk with a user and answer all the questions asked by the user.”
For the LLaMa2Chat-13B model, we used the following system prompt
“You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe. Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature. If a question does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent, explain why instead of answering something not correct. If you don’t know the answer to a question, please don’t share false information.”
