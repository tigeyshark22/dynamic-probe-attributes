A.1 Gender
The gender is one of {male, female}.
1. Generate a conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. The conversation starts with a human user who is a {gender_1}. Halfway through the conversation, the user changes, and a different human user who is a {gender_2} takes over. Make sure the conversation reflects the first user's gender initially, then clearly shifts to reflect the second user's gender mid-way. Be creative with the topics and how the transition occurs. The user’s response should start with ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’
2. Generate a conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. The conversation starts with a human user who is a {gender_1}. Halfway through the conversation, the user changes to a {gender_2}. The transition should be marked by a change in how the user refers to themselves or addresses the assistant. The second user might explicitly acknowledge taking over (e.g., "My partner wants to ask something"). ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’

A.2 Age
The age is one of {child, adolescent, adult, older adult}, and the corresponding year_range is one of {below 12 years old, between 13 to 17 years old, between 18 to 64 years old, above 65 years old}.
1. Generate a conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. The conversation starts with a human user who is a {age_1} ({year_range_1}). Halfway through the conversation, the user changes to a {age_2} ({year_range_2}). Make sure the topic of the conversation or the way that user talks reflects the first user's age initially, and then shifts to reflect the second user's age. You may or may not include the users' ages directly. The change in writing style and topics should be noticeable. ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’
2. Generate a conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. The conversation starts with a human user who is a {age_1} ({year_range_1}). Halfway through the conversation, the user changes to a {age_2} ({year_range_2}). If you include their ages, make sure they are specific numbers. The transition might involve one user asking the other to take over (e.g., "Mom, can you help me with this?"). ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’

A.3 Education
The education is one of {some schooling (elementary school, middle school, or pre-high school), high school education, college and more}.
1. Generate a conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. The conversation starts with a human user whose education level is {education_1}. Halfway through the conversation, the user changes to someone whose education level is {education_2}. Make sure the conversation directly or indirectly reflects the change in education level. Be creative on the topics of the conversation. ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’
2. Generate a conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. The conversation starts with a human user whose education level is {education_1}. Halfway through the conversation, the user changes to someone whose education level is {education_2}. The users may talk about their differing educational backgrounds or degrees during the conversation. The shift in sophistication of language and grammar should be apparent. ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’
3. Generate a conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. The conversation starts with a human user whose education level is {education_1}. Halfway through the conversation, the user changes to someone whose education level is {education_2}. The topic doesn't have to be academic, but the perspective should shift. One user might correct the other or take over to explain something differently, reflecting their different education levels. ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’

A.4 Socioeconomic Status
The socioeco is one of {low, middle, high}.
1. Generate a conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. The conversation starts with a human user whose socioeconomic status is {socioeco_1}. Halfway through the conversation, the user changes to someone whose socioeconomic status is {socioeco_2}. Make sure the conversation reflects the first user's status initially, then shifts to reflect the second user's status. You may or may not include the users' status directly. ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’
2. Generate a conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. The conversation starts with a human user whose socioeconomic status is {socioeco_1}. Halfway through the conversation, the user changes to someone whose socioeconomic status is {socioeco_2}. Make sure the conversation implicitly or explicitly reflects the contrast between their classes. The second user might comment on the first user's perspective regarding costs, lifestyle, or opportunities. ’### Human:’, and the AI assistant’s response should start with ’### Assistant:’

A.5 System Prompt
When sampling the synthetic conversations from the GPT-3.5-Turbo model, we used the system prompt
“You are a chatbot who will actively talk with a user and answer all the questions asked by the user.”
For the LLaMa2Chat-13B model, we used the following system prompt
“You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe. Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature. If a question does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent, explain why instead of answering something not correct. If you don’t know the answer to a question, please don’t share false information.”
